# TO DO

1. Create a landing page
    -Includes link to the quiz
2. Create pretty form DIVs
    -These will go inside the carousel-item divs
3. Come up with quiz questions
    -Should the quiz be linear or tree like?
4. Once we have a response for each question we plan on asking the user, how do we convert this to metrics?
    -For example, if the user indicates that they want to dance, how do we determine a range of danceability?
5. Check out spotify API. Once we have a range for each metric, how do we pick the songs and create a playlist?

6. Integrate Weather API 
    -How should the weather affect the metrics?
    -Which API to use?
